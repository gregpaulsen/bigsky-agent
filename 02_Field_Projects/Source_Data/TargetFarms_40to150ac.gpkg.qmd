  <title>Kern County GIS Tax Parcels (Land) 2025 Final</title>
  <abstract>This feature class contains "land" (surface rights) parcel boundaries delineated for property tax assessment purposes.
This feature class includes all private, tax-exempt, and state-assessed land parcels listed on the secured tax roll, but does not include mineral rights (subsurface) parcels, mobilehomes, or unsecured entities.
Parcels are modeled as planimetric polygons in a seamless fabric comprising the spatial extent of the County of Kern, in the State of California.
Tax Roll Data is available in separate database tables, which can be joined to the feature class using the APN9 field as the SQL join key.

This data is intended to provide a reasonable representation of parcels, as defined for property tax assessment purposes, that can be used easily in a computerized geographic information system. This data is not intended to replace the hardcopy assessment maps or any other official or unofficial county maps, and it is not to be construed as portraying legal ownership or divisions of land for purposes of zoning or subdivision law.</abstract>

  <history>This dataset was originally compiled by the Kern County Assessor, in May 2001, from two different sources: 1. The Kern Council of Governments provided the VWGIS data for the entire county (as a one-time dataset copy). 2. The City of Bakersfield provided the their own COBGIS data for the metropolitan Bakersfield area (and continues to share data on an ongoing basis).</history>
  <history>Data source: The Valley Wide GIS (VWGIS) program and data sets have been established for the purpose of coordinating regional transportation, land use, and air quality planning efforts. The VWGIS serves to provide regional data sets that can be accessed from one central location and which exists in a single, standardized format. Major data layers include roads, parcels, zoning, general plan, traffic analysis zones, demographics, and air quality grid. The project region is encompassed by the Counties of San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Merced, Madera, Fresno, Kings, Tulare, and Kern. The participants of the VWGIS program include the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District(SJVUAPCD), and the following transportation planning agencies: San Joaquin Council of Governments, Stanislaus Area Association of Governments, Merced County Association of Governments, Madera County Transportation Commission, Council of Fresno County Governments, Kings County Association of Governments, Tulare County Association of Governments, and the Kern Council of Governments. The program was implemented for 3 years, beginning in 1996 and ending 1998, during which time the Merced County Association of Governments had a special project staff who digitized GIS data from scanned photocopies of all assessment maps on file at the Kern County Assessor's Office.</history>
  <history>Data source: The City of Bakersfield has been developing GIS data and applications since the late 1980s. Their dataset encompasses the entire metropolitan Bakersfield area. In May 2001, the COBGIS data was filtered to obtain all parcels where full assessment map books were represented. The Valley-Wide GIS data was then clipped to remove all parcels in those map books, and the two files were then merged. The resulting file comprised the Kern County Assessor's first parcel polygon dataset. Errors and omissions were corrected over the next 3 years, and the first "complete" county dataset was ready in 2004.</history>
